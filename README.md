### The Dataset 
The Iris Flower dataset includes the characteristics of 150 iris flowers. Each of these flowers belongs to one of the three types of iris: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor and Iris virginica. Also, the characteristics of each flower include the length and width of the sepal and petal. Using these characteristics, we can imagine each flower as a point in a four-dimensional space, where these four quantities determine the coordinates of that point.
